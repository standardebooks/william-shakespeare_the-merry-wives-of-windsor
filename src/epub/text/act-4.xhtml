								<span>From time to time I have acquainted you</span>

								<span> With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who, mutually, hath answered my affection,</span>

								<span>So far forth as herself might be her chooser,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Even to my wish. I have a letter from her</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of such contents as you will wonder at;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The mirth whereof so larded with my matter</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That neither, singly, can be manifested</span>
								<br/>
								<span> Without the show of both; wherein fat Falstaff</span>

								<span>Hath a great scare: the image of the jest</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I’ll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Tonight at Herne’s oak, just ’twixt twelve and one,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The purpose why is here: in which disguise,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>While other jests are something rank on foot,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Her father hath commanded her to slip</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Away with Slender, and with him at Eton</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Immediately to marry; she hath consented:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now, sir,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Her mother, even strong against that match</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That he shall likewise shuffle her away,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>While other sports are tasking of their minds;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And at the deanery, where a priest attends,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Straight marry her: to this her mother’s plot</span>
								<br/>
								<span>She seemingly obedient likewise hath</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Made promise to the doctor. Now thus it rests:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Her father means she shall be all in white;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And in that habit, when Slender sees his time</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To take her by the hand and bid her go,</span>
								<br/>
								<span> She shall go with him: her mother hath intended</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The better to denote her to the doctor⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For they must all be mask’d and vizarded⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That quaint in green she shall be loose enrob’d,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With ribands pendent, flaring ‘bout her head;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To pinch her by the hand: and, on that token,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The maid hath given consent to go with him.</span>
